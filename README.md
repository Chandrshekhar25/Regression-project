Regression project
**Bike Share Demand Prediction Capstone Project**

**Project Overview:**
Analyzed bike share data to predict the number of bikes required at each hour in urban cities. This project aimed to ensure an optimal supply of rental bikes, reducing waiting times and improving mobility.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, identify trends, and check for correlations.
- Built and evaluated various models including Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Random Forest Regressor.
- Conducted hyperparameter tuning and regularization to optimize model performance.

**Key Findings:**
- Demand is highest during non-winter months and on weekdays, especially during office hours.
- Holidays see a significant drop in bike rentals.
- Polynomial Regression performed best with an R-squared value of 88%.

**Conclusion & Recommendations:**
- Increase bike availability during peak office hours and non-winter months.
- Adjust supply based on weekday and weekend patterns to meet varying demand.
- Consider special promotions during holidays to boost rentals.

**Technologies Used:**
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

This project showcased my ability to analyze data, build predictive models, and derive actionable insights to improve urban mobility solutions.
